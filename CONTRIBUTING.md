## Commit Messages

Really liked the format proposed by [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).

Commit messages should follow the Semantic Commit Messages format:

```text
label(namespace): title

description

footer
```

1. *label* is one of the following:
    - `fix` - bug fixes.
    - `feat` - features.
    - `deployment` - changes to CircleCI or Kubernetes configuration
    - `docs` - changes to docs
    - `test` - changes to tests
    - `style` - code style: spaces/alignment/wrapping etc.
    - `chore` - build-related work, e.g. eslint / tsconfig config changes
2. *namespace* is put in parenthesis after label and is optional. Must be lowercase.
3. *title* is a brief summary of changes.
4. *description* is **optional**, new-line separated from title and is in present tense.
5. *footer* is **optional**, new-line separated from *description* and contains "fixes" / "references" attribution to github issues.
6. *footer* should also include "BREAKING CHANGE" if current API clients will break due to this change. It should explain what changed and how to get the old behavior.

Example:

```txt
test(middleware): Add tests for middlewares

- add build script to keep the project updated
- add test for middlewares
- add test for duplicate accounts on register
- various other minor fixes

Fixes #123, Fixes #234
```
