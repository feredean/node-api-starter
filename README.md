# TypeScript Node API StarterPack
[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/feredean/node-api-starter.svg)](https://david-dm.org/feredean/node-api-starter) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/feredean/node-api-starter.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/feredean/node-api-starter)

**Live Demo**: [https://node-api-starter.experiments.explabs.io](https://node-api-starter.experiments.explabs.io)

A boilerplate for Node.js APIs.

This project has two purposes:

1. Provide a boilerplate for modern Node.js API development with the following requirements
    - fully configured development environment
    - created to be used primarily as a backend for modern SPAs or PWAs
    - have all the most common requirements already implemented (authentication, database integration, CI integration and more)
    <!-- - in depth documentation that does not stop at the app and also discusses deployment options with Kubernetes -->
1. Serve as a reference for implementations that can vary from how to set up continuous deployment using CircleCI to getting rid of those mildly annoying `../../../../` imports.

# Requirements

There are two ways to go about handling requirements. You can either follow the quick start path where you dump all the dependencies in your system or you can go down the fancy setup that will give you more flexibility in the future by using nvm and docker.

## Quick start

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Fancy start

- Install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update)
- Configure nvm [Shell Integration](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration) (highly recommend setting up zsh together with [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)). Once you set it up it will automatically change the node version if the project has a `.nvmrc` file.
- Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- Run MongoDB in a docker container `docker run --name mongo-dev -p 27017:27017 mongo:4.0`

# Getting started

Clone the repository

```shell
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/feredean/node-api-starter.git <project_name>

# Change directory
cd <project_name>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Copy the .env.example contents into the .env we use to store secrets
cat .env.example > .env

# The STARTER_PATH env variable will be needed each time you run the API, be sure to persist it
export STARTER_PATH="$(pwd)/dist"

# Run (development mode) the API on port 9100
npm run watch
```

To build the project in VS Code press `cmd + shift + b`. You can also run tasks using the command pallet (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:9100` and you now have access to your API

# Build scripts

[npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) can be found in `package.json` in the `scripts` section. They can call each other which means it's very easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.

Any build that runs the compiled `dist/server.js` must have the NODE_PATH set up. This is required for the [import path workaround](#import-path-workaround).

| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start`                   | Runs node on `dist/server.js` which is the apps entry point                                                      |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs `build-ts` and `lint` build tasks                                                               |
| `build-ts`                | Compiles all source `.ts` files to `.js` files in the `dist` folder                                              |
| `watch`                   | Runs `watch-ts` and `watch-node` concurrently. Use this for development                                          |
| `watch-node`              | Runs node with nodemon so the process restarts if it crashes or a change is made. Used in the main `watch` task  |
| `watch-ts`                | Same as `build-ts` but continuously watches `.ts` files and re-compiles when needed                              |
| `test`                    | Runs tests using Jest test runner verbosely and generate a coverage report                                       |
| `watch-test`              | Runs tests in watch mode                                                                                         |
| `lint`                    | Runs ESLint on project files                                                                                     |
| `check-deps`              | Audits and upgrades (inside package.json run npm install to apply) dependencies to their latest stable version   |

# Import path workaround

> module names are considered resource identifiers, and are mapped to the output as they appear in the source

As a result the import paths will be copied over to the compiled js require paths. The compiled code will not work since the tsconfig options are not applied to the output. The Typescript compiler does not want to become a build tool. Normally in frontend projects this is taken care of by build tools such as webpack. There are packages that can solve this problem, more on this issue and possible solutions can be found in <https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10866>.

The approach chosen for this project is to:

1. Add a `NODE_PATH` env variable that points to the `dist` folder. The path will be taken from an env variable in the system. For deployment we will later set the path in the Dockerfile after copying over the dist.

    ```json
        "watch-node": "NODE_PATH=$STARTER_PATH nodemon dist/server.js"
    ```

2. Let the compiler know to look in the src folder for modules.

    ```json
    {
        "paths": {
            "*": [
                "src/*",
                "node_modules/*",
                "src/types/*"
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

# Debugging

Debugging TypeScript requires source maps to be enabled in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
"compilerOptions" {
    "sourceMap": true
}
```

In `.vscode` folder you can find the `launch.json` file. Here we configure VS Code to attach a debugger to the node process.

```json
{
    "type": "node",
    "request": "attach",
    "name": "Attach Debugger to Process ID",
    "processId": "${command:PickProcess}",
    "protocol": "inspector"
}
```

Once this configuration is added make sure the app is running `npm run watch`, add breapoints, hit `F5`, select the `node dist/server.js` process (usually the first one) and you're ready to go!

# Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). When writing tests that interact with mongoose keep [this](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/jest.html) in mind.

## Configure Jest

We will need a new `test/tsconfig.json` file in order to properly load modules in our test suites.

In the `jest.config.js` we will add `setupFilesAfterEnv: ["./test/setup.ts"]` where we have a helper function that connects to the test database we will use in order to run the integration tests. The Typescript compilation to JS will happen in memory using the `test/tsconfig.json` file.

## Running tests

To run the tests simply use `npm test`. If you want to use jest `watch mode` use `npm run watch-test`.

## Linting

This year [Palantir has announced](https://medium.com/palantir/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9) the deprecation of TSLint.

> In order to avoid bifurcating the linting tool space for TypeScript, we therefore plan to deprecate TSLint and focus our efforts instead on improving ESLint’s TypeScript support.

This project is using `ESLint` with `typescript-eslint/recommended` settings.
